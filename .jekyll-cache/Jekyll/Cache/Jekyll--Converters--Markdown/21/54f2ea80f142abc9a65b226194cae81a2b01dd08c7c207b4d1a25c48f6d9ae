<h4 id="what-i-do">What I do</h4>
<p>Broadly, I use mathematical tools to answer questions related to infectious diseases. I am in the third year of my PhD at UC Berkeley in Computational Biology, where I am co-advised by <a href="https://publichealth.berkeley.edu/people/joseph-lewnard/">Joe Lewnard</a> and <a href="https://bootslab.org/">Mike Boots</a>. Before coming to Berkeley for graduate school, I graduated from the University of Chicago with a BS in Computational and Applied Mathematics. There I had the opportunity to work under <a href="https://cobeylab.uchicago.edu/">Sarah Cobey</a> on modeling B Cell selection.</p>

<h4 id="why-i-do-it">Why I do it</h4>
<p>I started my journey to the intersection of mathematics and biology as a undergraduate who knew nothing except that I liked math. I was fortunate to have a series of mentors and advisors who showed me that biology actually moved in concert with mathematical ideas. I was captivated with the idea of abstracting the dynamics of biology into a mathematical framework.</p>

<p>Infectious disease dynamics interested me particularly as an area where there was a <a href="https://doi.org/10.1098/rspa.1927.0118">long tradition</a> of using mathematics to understand biological processes. I also liked that it was “biology you can see” (after having taking fundamentals of molecular biology I knew my interests lied elsewhere), in the sense that these processes happen on the scale of populations (I have since become fascinated with within host processes as well but I had to start somewhere). The covid-19 pandemic has since even further galvanized my interest in and recognition of the need for science that can unite the quantitative and biological understandings of the world.</p>

<h4 id="what-i-like">What I like</h4>
<p>I love games of all kinds and have been an avid fan of board, card, video, and sports games all my life. I run a weekly game of Dungeons and Dragons, revealing that I don’t take off my nerd hat when I get home from the lab. I root with full throated cheers for Detroit sports, the Lions, Tigers, Red Wings, and Pistons. I also watch too much college football for one person, splitting my allegiance between the Universities of Michigan and California.</p>

<p>I also keep a small set of self improvement hobbies, which currently include running, learning Julia (the programming language), and Japanese (the people language)!</p>

<p>In addition to my hobbies and interests, I love when academia is an arena of ideas from researchers of all backgrounds. However, I acknowledge this is not always the case; and am committed to amplifying the voices of my scientists who are LGBTQ+ or BIPOC to make academic spaces as inclusive as possible. And to speaking out against discrimination wherever it is found. My academic and life’s journeys have been fortified by my friends and colleagues from all backgrounds, and my wish is for everyone who wishes to be able to find the same family in science that I have.</p>
