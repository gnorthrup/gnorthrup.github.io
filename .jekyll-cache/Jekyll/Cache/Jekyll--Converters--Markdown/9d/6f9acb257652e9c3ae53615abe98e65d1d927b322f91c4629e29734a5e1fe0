<p>My research centers on the use of mathematics to understand how infectious diseases spread through a population. This can be done in many ways, with different tools to suit different jobs.</p>

<h4 id="epidemiology">Epidemiology</h4>
<p>Infectious disease epidemiology represents a set of tools for investigating who gets diseases, why they may get them, and what sorts of interventions can be used to mitigate their burdens on populations. I am particularly interested in the epidemiology of recurrent infection processes and acquired immunity. I have submitted work to improve the tools we can use to make use of data from these systems already, and am excited to extend these methods to more pathogens.</p>

<h4 id="evolution-of-infectious-disease">Evolution of Infectious Disease</h4>
<p>I am keenly interested in developing general theory for ecology and evolution of infectious diseases as well. Having been introduced to the methods of adaptive dynamics during graduate school, I am now applying these methods to models of infectious disease to understand how eco-evolutionary feedback loops can impact disease dynamics in a community. In particular, where multiple pathogens might be vying for host resources or multiple strains may be emerging in antigenic space.</p>

<h3 id="collaborations">Collaborations</h3>
<p>Science is at its best when people with different expertise and interests can join forces, as I have experienced on a number of projects. Working with collaborators in Cambodia, England, and at various institutions across the US has strengthened my own understanding of the scientific landscape.
