<p>I am in the third year of my PhD at UC Berkeley in Computational Biology, where I am co-advised by <a href="https://publichealth.berkeley.edu/people/joseph-lewnard/">Joe Lewnard</a> and <a href="https://bootslab.org/">Mike Boots</a>.</p>

<p>This is some information about who I am and the things I like. Here I also talk about my research and maybe there is a <a href="../docs/GrahamNorthrupCV2020.pdf">link to a CV</a>.
