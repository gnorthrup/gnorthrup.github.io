<h4 id="what-i-do">What I do</h4>
<p>Broadly, I use mathematical tools to answer questions related to infectious diseases. I am in the third year of my PhD at UC Berkeley in Computational Biology, where I am co-advised by <a href="https://publichealth.berkeley.edu/people/joseph-lewnard/">Joe Lewnard</a> and <a href="https://bootslab.org/">Mike Boots</a>. Before coming to Berkeley for graduate school, I graduated from the University of Chicago with a BS in Computational and Applied Mathematics. There I had the opportunity to work under <a href="https://cobeylab.uchicago.edu/">Sarah Cobey</a> on modeling B Cell selection.</p>

<h4 id="why-i-do-it">Why I do it</h4>
<p>I started my journey to the intersection of mathematics and biology as a undergraduate who knew nothing except that I liked math. I was fortunate to have a series of mentors and advisors who showed me that biology actually moved in concert with mathematical ideas. I was captivated with the idea of abstracting the dynamics of biology into a mathematical framework.</p>

<p>Infectious disease dynamics interested me particularly as an area where there was a <a href="https://doi.org/10.1098/rspa.1927.0118">long tradition</a> of using mathematics to understand biological processes. I also liked that it was ‚Äúbiology you can see‚Äù (after having taking fundamentals of molecular biologist I knew my interests lied elsewhere!)</p>

<p>This is some information about who I am and the things I like. Here I also talk about my research and maybe there is a <a href="../docs/GrahamNorthrupCV2020.pdf">link to a CV</a>.
