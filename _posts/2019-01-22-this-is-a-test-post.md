<p>This should be what shows up under the teaser image. This is a test to see what happens if the first paragraph is so long that it doesn't really make sense for the whole thing to be included in the teaser. I'm assuming that it will just cut off after a certain number of characters but we will see.</p>

<p>This would then be the second paragraph of the same article, that you only see when you click on it</p>
