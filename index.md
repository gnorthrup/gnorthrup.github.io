I'm a PhD graduate from the University of California, Berkeley in the <a href="https://ccb.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank" style="color:blue;">Center for Computational Biology</a>. This is my personal website where I aggregate things like my <a href="../publications/" style="color:blue;">publication history</a> and information about my <a href="../research/" style="color:blue;">current research</a>. Feel free to take a look around.
