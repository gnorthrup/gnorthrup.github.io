I'm a PhD candidate at UC Berkeley in the <a href="https://ccb.berkeley.edu/">Center for Computational Biology</a>. This is my personal website where I aggregate things like my <a href="../publications/">publication history</a> and information about my <a href="../research/">current research</a>. Feel free to take a look around!
